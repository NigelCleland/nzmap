nzmap
=====

An initial attempt at mapping NZ based on d3 topoJSON.
Data supplied through the Electricity Authority data warehouse.
Currently svg mappings are based on GXP regions where a GXP is mapped to individual NSP/ICPs.

This mapping will be used to plot real-time spot prices in the NZ Electricity market.
